## Developer notes

If you've cloned this repo and want to recreate the wget mirror yourself, check out the [Makefile](Makefile).

Basically:

- `make snap` to execute script(s) for creating a mirror of the target site mirroring the target site (if ./docs doesn't already exist)

- `make serve` to view the locally mirrored site

- `make clean`  to clean out an existing mirror (wget.log and ./docs/)
